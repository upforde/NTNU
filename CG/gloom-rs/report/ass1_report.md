i) The phenominon is called clipping.

ii) Clipping occurs when an object pertrudes outside of the bounds of the clipping box, which in OpenGL is a 2x2x2 rectangle with it's middle in the origin.

iii) The purpose of clipping is to throw away everything that sticks out of the clipping box, so that it doesn't need to be rendered. It also ensures that the objects behind the camera are also not rendered.
