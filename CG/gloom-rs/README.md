## Report

You're free to write your report any way you'd like, as long as it is delivered as a PDF file.

To spread the word of *"the one true way"*, I have included a `pandoc` report skeleton in the `report` folder.
To use pandoc, make sure you have `pandoc` installed along with a supported latex engine.
Make sure it works before using it to write your report.

## Code delivery

To make a code archive (`source.zip`) for uploading to blackboard: run either `create_code_archive_for_blackboard_LINUX.sh` or `create_code_archive_for_blackboard_WINDOWS.bat`.
